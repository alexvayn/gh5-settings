# Introduction

This repo captures all the settings I use on my GH5 to shoot video.

[Settings File](./settings/CAMSET01.DAT)

# Customizations

* Borrowed the starting point from Griffin Hammond: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqk8Nzo6wWE](How to set up your new Panasonic GH5 for Filmmaking
)
* Overrode the C1, C2, C3 shortcut dials as described by Johnny Amiri: [How To QUICKLY Switch Frame Rates on the GH5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5enwZmxdB9M)
  * C1: 4K @ 24fps (100Mbps) - main shooting mode
  * C2: 4K @ 60fps (150Mbps) - great for B-roll and editing in post
  * C3: 1080p @ 120fps (100Mbps) - buttery smooth slow-mo
* Eliminated all shutter sounds when taking pictures
